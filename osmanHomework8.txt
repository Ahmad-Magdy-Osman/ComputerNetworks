1-Suppose Host A sends two sequential TCP segments to Host B over TCP. Sequence number of the first segment is 430, its size is 30 bytes. What is the sequence number of the second segment?


2-Suppose Host A sends two sequential TCP segments to Host B over TCP. Sequence number of the first segment is 430, its size is 30 bytes. First packet is lost, but the second is delivered successfully. What is the acknowledgement number sent from Host B to Host A in the ACK message?
